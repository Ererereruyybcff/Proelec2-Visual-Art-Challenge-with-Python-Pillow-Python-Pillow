This poster was designed using Python’s Pillow library, a tool for editing and creating images. The gradient background was chosen to make the text and logo stand out more vividly. At the top, the College of Computing & Information Sciences (CCIS) and the team name “PHANTOMS” are displayed in bold fonts to catch attention. The slogan “Unleash the Phantoms!” is highlighted in yellow to give it energy and emphasis. At the center, the team logo brings character and excitement to the design, while the motto at the bottom “United • Strong • Unstoppable” reflects teamwork and determination. Pillow made it possible to put these elements together by handling the text, colors, and layout, creating a poster that feels both dynamic and spirited.
